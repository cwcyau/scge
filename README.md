*scge* is a package to simulate realistic gene expression data, initially for single cell genomics but generalisable to other sources of gene expression data. Models are fitted to reproduce the mean expression, mean-variance, mean-censorship and correlation relationships within the data. Parameters from an example fit are provided should data be unavailable.

## Installation 

With the *devtools* package installed run `devtools::install_github("tom-jin/scge")`.
